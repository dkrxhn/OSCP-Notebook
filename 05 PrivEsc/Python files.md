- absence of parentheses in print argument indicates script is written in python 2
	- Python 2: print is a statement, so parentheses are optional unless needed for grouping.
	- Python 3: print is a function, so parentheses are required:
		- print("Website is up")
- Using input() in Python2 can lead to security vulnerabilities because it evaluates user input as code.
	- Python 2:
		- input() function:
			 - Parses the user input as a Python expression using eval().
			- Equivalent to eval(raw_input(prompt)).
			- Dangerous if user input is not trusted, as it can execute arbitrary code.
		- raw_input() function:
			- Reads user input as a string without evaluation.
	- Python 3:
		- input() function:
			- Reads user input as a string.
			- Equivalent to raw_input() in Python 2.
		- raw_input() function:
			- Removed in Python 3.
			- If you need to evaluate user input as code (which is generally discouraged), you must explicitly use eval()

__import__('os').system('id')
- executes id command from python input()
